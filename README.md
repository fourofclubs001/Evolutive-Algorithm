# Evolutive-Algorithm
This algorithm is a natural evolution model.

It takes into account:
- variable agents quantity
- different speed and strenght (power) between agents
- agents reproduction with mutation on their speed and power
- variable mutation rate
- variable food quantity
- variable food value

Each agent has it own speed, power, and energy. When an agent energy is lower than 0 it dies; when its energy is higher than the "reproduction_energy", it clone itself with mutations
